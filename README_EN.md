# CLIProxyAPI Pro

CLIProxyAPI Pro is a minimal customization-layer collection for two upstream projects:

- `cliproxyapi-pro-core/` — backend Docker build customization for `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`.
- `cliproxyapi-pro-management/` — frontend management-center customization for `router-for-me/Cli-Proxy-API-Management-Center`.

This project does not maintain a full fork of either upstream project. Instead, it keeps repeatable patches, overlays, and build workflows. Release workflows fetch the latest upstream release, apply the Pro customization layer, and publish the resulting artifacts.

## Key features

- Persistent request data with import, export, and WebDAV backup.
- Account inspection for Codex, Claude, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Kimi, and xAI.
- Persistent inspection quota and account-error state for quota management and auth-file health views.
- Optional automatic enable, disable, delete, and token-refresh actions.
- Optional deep probes for Antigravity soft bans and xAI availability anomalies.
- A routing-policy page for upstream routing behavior and provider-scoped request-state protection.

## Backend and frontend relationship

Some `cliproxyapi-pro-management` features depend on enhanced management APIs provided by `cliproxyapi-pro-core`.

Core dependencies are grouped under these stable prefixes:

```text
/v0/management/usage
/v0/management/usage/*
/v0/management/quota/fetch
/v0/management/account-inspection/*
/v0/management/routing-policy
/v0/management/routing-policy/*
```

See `cliproxyapi-pro-core/README_EN.md` for the complete method/path list.

Request monitoring stores diagnostic fields such as TTFT, HTTP status code, structured error, reasoning effort, and service tier, and exposes the `/usage/aggregates` server-side aggregation API. The management UI deduplicates increments by event ID, receives SSE updates from SQLite commit notifications, catches up by cursor after disconnects, prefers server-side aggregates for trends and rankings, uses stable server-side paging for log filters and combined raw-text/account-metadata search, and pauses live rendering in background tabs. `/usage/status` returns recent dead-letter samples with sensitive fields redacted.

Account inspection is executed by the backend only. The management UI configures schedules, starts or controls runs, polls status/progress/results, streams logs and live status over WebSocket/WSS, and confirms manual actions. Backend automatic actions support consecutive-confirmation gating, and quota cache entries record parser version plus response-shape hashes to help diagnose upstream field changes.

The top-level Routing Policy page combines upstream routing, session stickiness, retry, account switching, cooldown, and quota-fallback settings with request-state protection for Antigravity, xAI, Codex, Gemini CLI, Gemini, Gemini Interactions, Vertex AI, AI Studio, Claude, and Kimi. Protection is disabled by default; `observe` records matches and `enforce` can disable accounts. Automatic and manual release affect only accounts owned by this protection policy.

During backend inspection, eligible auth records are refreshed before quota/account probing when they are already in their normal refresh window. The inspection refresh path skips API-key accounts, accounts not yet due for refresh, and accounts still blocked by `NextRefreshAfter`; disabled accounts are allowed to refresh. If refresh succeeds, probing uses the refreshed auth. If refresh fails, the account is kept and probing is skipped for that account.

The backend forces `usage-statistics-enabled=true` and `remote-management.panel-github-repository=https://github.com/kkkk24juastin/CLIProxyAPI-Pro` at startup, then writes those values back to `config.yaml` only when the loaded config differs.

If the management UI is used with the unmodified upstream backend, request monitoring, SQLite persistence, model prices, backend account inspection, and routing protection will show errors or empty data.

## Release workflows

### Unified Pro release

Workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/release-core.yml
```

The GitHub Release version is based on the upstream core version with a `-pro` suffix.

In addition to scheduled checks and manual dispatches, this workflow runs when the core customization layer changes on `main`. A code push forces a rebuild even when the upstream core tag is unchanged.

Example:

```text
v<core-version>-pro
```

Overview:

1. Checks the latest upstream `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI` release.
2. Computes the Pro release tag, for example `v<core-version>-pro`.
3. Checks out the latest upstream core and upstream management releases.
4. Applies core patches, runs the full Go test suite, then builds and pushes the multi-architecture Docker image.
5. Applies the management customization layer, runs customization tests, frontend tests, and lint, then builds the single-file `management.html`.
6. Creates or updates the current repository GitHub Release and uploads `management.html`.
7. Records the core upstream, management upstream, and customization revisions in the release notes.
8. Deletes old workflow runs.

Docker image tags use the Pro release tag:

```text
latest
v<core-version>-pro
```

During Docker builds, `CLIPROXY_VERSION` selects the upstream core tag, while `CLIPROXY_BUILD_VERSION` sets the Pro runtime version, so the image reports `v<core-version>-pro` while still building from upstream `v<core-version>` source. Images use CGO-enabled Debian builds with dynamic-library plugin support. This project does not publish standalone platform binaries; the GitHub Release only carries the management panel asset `management.html`.

### Management asset update

Workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/release-management.yml
```

This workflow no longer creates a separate release. It rebuilds `management.html` when management upstream changes, when the management customization layer is pushed to `main`, when the latest release is missing the asset, or when manually triggered, then uploads it to the current repository latest release.

Overview:

1. Checks the latest upstream `router-for-me/Cli-Proxy-API-Management-Center` release.
2. Reads the management upstream version recorded in the current repository latest release notes.
3. If management upstream is newer, the management customization layer was pushed, or the latest release has no `management.html`, checks out the latest management upstream release.
4. Applies the `cliproxyapi-pro-management` customization layer.
5. Runs customization tests, `bun run test`, `bun run lint`, and `bun run build`; the Bun version comes from upstream `package.json`.
6. Renames `dist/index.html` to `management.html`.
7. Uploads and clobbers `management.html` on the current latest release.
8. Updates the management version mapping and release notes section.

This keeps `remote-management.panel-github-repository=https://github.com/kkkk24juastin/CLIProxyAPI-Pro` compatible with GitHub `/releases/latest`, because the latest release always carries `management.html`.

## Local build

### Build the core Docker image

Published image:

```bash
docker pull sfun/cliproxyapi-pro:latest
```

Build locally:

```bash
docker build -t cliproxyapi-pro ./cliproxyapi-pro-core
```

Build a specific upstream release:

```bash
UPSTREAM_TAG=vX.Y.Z
PRO_TAG="${UPSTREAM_TAG}-pro"
docker build \
  --build-arg CLIPROXY_VERSION="${UPSTREAM_TAG}" \
  --build-arg CLIPROXY_BUILD_VERSION="${PRO_TAG}" \
  -t "cliproxyapi-pro:${PRO_TAG}" \
  ./cliproxyapi-pro-core
```

The Dockerfiles pin builder and runtime base images by immutable digest. Debian package repositories and external toolchains remain rolling dependencies, so the project does not claim a cross-time byte-for-byte guarantee for complete images. For a deterministic local source binary, also pass an immutable `CLIPROXY_COMMIT` and a fixed `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`; release workflows derive that epoch from immutable source commits and normalize all core archives.

### Apply the management customization layer

```bash
./cliproxyapi-pro-management/apply.sh /path/to/Cli-Proxy-API-Management-Center
```

Or:

```bash
python3 ./cliproxyapi-pro-management/apply_customizations.py /path/to/Cli-Proxy-API-Management-Center
```

The target must be an upstream management-center checkout containing:

- `src/`
- `package.json`

After applying customizations, run in the target directory:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run test
bun run lint
bun run type-check
VERSION=review bun run build
```

## Runtime data directory

The core image uses this directory by default:

```text
/CLIProxyAPI/usage
```

It stores:

- usage SQLite database: `usage.sqlite`
- account-inspection schedule file: `account-inspection-schedule.json`
- latest account-inspection result snapshot: `account-inspection-snapshot.json`
- quota cache
- model prices
- monitoring settings

Usage export/import uses NDJSON metadata records for model prices, quota cache, monitoring settings, the account-inspection schedule, and the latest finished inspection-result snapshot, so WebDAV backup restore can recover the monitoring-related state together with usage events. Restored inspection snapshots are read-only for migration and troubleshooting; a new full inspection must run before rechecking accounts, refreshing tokens, or changing account state. Inspection logs are not included. Monitoring log retention runs daily at 02:00 server local time and also runs once immediately when settings are saved; WebDAV backups can use separate retention days, deleting expired `usage-export-*.jsonl` files after successful backups.

New exports include an integrity manifest. Management API and UI imports reject or require confirmation for manifest-free legacy backups; during the compatibility transition, Docker WebDAV restore force-enables legacy import while continuing to verify manifest-backed backups strictly.

Configure a persistent volume for this directory in production.

## Design principles

This project follows a minimal customization approach:

- Do not vendor full upstream source code.
- Prefer overlays and patches for customization.
- Reapply the customization layer when upstream updates.
- Keep documentation, scripts, and workflows verifiable and repeatable.
