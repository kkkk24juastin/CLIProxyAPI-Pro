# CLIProxyAPI Pro Core

Customized Docker build layer for upstream `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`.

This directory does not maintain a full fork of upstream. During Docker build it downloads an upstream release, copies in the local `embeddedusage/` package, applies the patch script in `patches/`, and builds a multi-arch image for the Pro deployment.

## What this customization adds

### Embedded usage service

`embeddedusage/` is copied into upstream as:

```text
internal/embeddedusage
```

The patch layer starts the service with the main API process, enables upstream usage statistics, and exposes the service under the management API prefix:

```text
/v0/management/usage
```

By default it stores SQLite data at:

```text
/CLIProxyAPI/usage/usage.sqlite
```

The image declares `/CLIProxyAPI/usage` as a Docker volume so usage data and account-inspection schedule state can survive container replacement.

### Usage API

The embedded service exposes these management routes:

- `GET /v0/management/usage` — aggregated usage payload for the management UI.
- `GET /v0/management/usage/export` — JSONL/NDJSON export.
- `POST /v0/management/usage/import` — JSONL/NDJSON import.
- `GET /v0/management/usage/status` — service status and record counts.
- `GET /v0/management/usage/quota-cache` — read quota cache entries or stats.
- `PUT /v0/management/usage/quota-cache` — write a quota cache entry.
- `DELETE /v0/management/usage/quota-cache` — delete quota cache entries.
- `GET /v0/management/usage/model-prices` — read model price settings.
- `PUT /v0/management/usage/model-prices` — write model price settings.

### JSONL usage backup and restore

`/usage/export` returns `application/x-ndjson`, one JSON object per line.

The export contains usage events and may also include metadata records:

- `model_prices` — persisted model price settings used by the management UI cost view.
- `account_inspection_schedule` — persisted backend account-inspection schedule.

`/usage/import` accepts the same JSONL format. It imports usage events, restores model prices, and restores the account-inspection schedule when that metadata record is present. Older event-only JSONL files remain compatible.

Example import response fields:

```json
{
  "added": 100,
  "skipped": 5,
  "total": 105,
  "failed": 0,
  "modelPrices": 12,
  "modelPriceRecords": 1,
  "accountInspectionSchedule": true,
  "accountInspectionScheduleRecords": 1
}
```

### SQLite-backed quota cache

The embedded service stores quota snapshots in SQLite for these providers:

- Antigravity
- Claude
- Codex
- Gemini CLI
- Kimi

The management UI reads and writes this cache through `/usage/quota-cache`, so quota cards can be restored after page refreshes, browser changes, and backend restarts.

### Backend account inspection scheduler

The patch layer adds backend account-inspection routes under the management API:

- `GET /v0/management/account-inspection/schedule`
- `GET /v0/management/account-inspection/status`
- `GET /v0/management/account-inspection/logs` (WebSocket/WSS log and status stream)
- `PUT /v0/management/account-inspection/schedule`
- `POST /v0/management/account-inspection/run`
- `POST /v0/management/account-inspection/pause`
- `POST /v0/management/account-inspection/resume`
- `POST /v0/management/account-inspection/stop`
- `POST /v0/management/account-inspection/actions`

The scheduler can inspect accounts for:

- Antigravity
- Claude
- Codex
- Gemini CLI
- Kimi

It supports provider filtering, worker limits, retry/timeout settings, sampling, usage-threshold decisions, progress/status/log/result snapshots, pause/resume/stop controls, manual actions, and optional automatic actions for quota exhaustion, quota recovery, and account errors.

Before probing an account, the scheduler can refresh its auth record when it is already in the normal upstream refresh window. This inspection refresh path reuses upstream provider refresh logic and persistence, allows disabled accounts, skips API-key accounts, skips accounts not yet due, and respects `NextRefreshAfter`. If refresh succeeds, probing uses the refreshed auth; if refresh fails, the scheduler keeps the account and skips probing it for that run.

The schedule file defaults to:

```text
/CLIProxyAPI/usage/account-inspection-schedule.json
```

Override it with `ACCOUNT_INSPECTION_SCHEDULE_PATH` if needed.

### Root redirect and health response

The patch layer also changes upstream API behavior:

- `/` redirects to `/management.html`.
- `/healthz` returns a richer CLIProxyAPI status payload while preserving `HEAD /healthz`.

### Management panel defaults

The patch layer changes upstream's default remote management panel repository to:

```text
https://github.com/ssfun/CLIProxyAPI-Pro
```

This affects the built-in default config, `config.example.yaml`, and the management asset updater's default latest-release API URL.

### Runtime helper process

`entrypoint.sh` can start the bundled Komari agent before the main API process when both variables are configured:

- `KOMARI_SERVER`
- `KOMARI_SECRET`

It then starts `CLIProxyAPI` and optionally restores the latest usage backup from WebDAV.

## Repository layout

- `Dockerfile` — downloads upstream CLIProxyAPI, applies this customization layer, and builds the final image.
- `entrypoint.sh` — starts Komari, starts the main API, and restores WebDAV usage backups.
- `embeddedusage/` — embedded SQLite usage service and management routes.
- `patches/apply_upstream_patches.py` — patches upstream source during Docker build.
- `patches/account_inspection_scheduler.go` — backend account-inspection scheduler injected into upstream management handlers.
- `.github/workflows/release-core.yml` — image publish, usage backup, Render deployment trigger, Telegram notification, and run cleanup.

## Docker build

Published image:

```bash
docker pull sfun/cliproxyapi-pro:latest
```

Build latest upstream release:

```bash
docker build -t cliproxyapi-pro ./cliproxyapi-pro-core
```

Build a specific upstream release:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg CLIPROXY_VERSION=v6.10.1 \
  -t cliproxyapi-pro:v6.10.1 \
  ./cliproxyapi-pro-core
```

Build args:

- `CLIPROXY_REPO` — upstream repository, default `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`.
- `CLIPROXY_VERSION` — upstream release tag. If empty, the Dockerfile resolves the latest release.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — optional token for GitHub API requests.

## Runtime environment variables

### Usage service

- `USAGE_SERVICE_ENABLED` — default `true`; set to `false`/`0`/`no`/`off` to disable the embedded service.
- `USAGE_DATA_DIR` — default `/CLIProxyAPI/usage`.
- `USAGE_DB_PATH` — default `/CLIProxyAPI/usage/usage.sqlite`.
- `USAGE_BATCH_SIZE` — default `100`.
- `USAGE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` — default `500`.
- `USAGE_QUERY_LIMIT` — default `50000`.

### Account inspection

- `ACCOUNT_INSPECTION_SCHEDULE_PATH` — optional schedule JSON path. Defaults to `USAGE_DATA_DIR/account-inspection-schedule.json`.

### WebDAV usage restore

When all variables below are configured, `entrypoint.sh` waits for the local API to become ready, downloads the latest backup from WebDAV, and imports it into `/v0/management/usage/import`:

- `WEBDAV_URL`
- `WEBDAV_USERNAME`
- `WEBDAV_PASSWORD`
- `MANAGEMENT_PASSWORD`

Restore lookup supports both backup names:

```text
usage-export-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
usage-export-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jsonl
```

The import request uses:

```text
Content-Type: application/x-ndjson
```

### Komari agent

- `KOMARI_SERVER`
- `KOMARI_SECRET`

## GitHub Actions

Workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/release-core.yml
```

The workflow:

1. Checks the latest upstream CLIProxyAPI release.
2. Compares it with the latest Docker Hub image tag.
3. Builds and pushes a `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` Docker image when upstream is newer.
4. Exports usage statistics from one or more running CPA instances to WebDAV.
5. Triggers one or more Render deployments.
6. Sends a Telegram notification.
7. Deletes old workflow runs.

### Required Docker secrets

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`

### Multi-instance usage backup

The workflow uses one optional JSON secret for all WebDAV backup targets:

```text
CLIPROXY_USAGE_BACKUP_TARGETS
```

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "cpa-main",
    "api_url": "https://cpa-main.example.com",
    "management_password": "management-password-1",
    "webdav_url": "https://webdav.example.com/cpa-main",
    "webdav_username": "webdav-user-1",
    "webdav_password": "webdav-password-1"
  }
]
```

Each target is exported from its own CPA API and uploaded to its own WebDAV directory as:

```text
usage-export-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jsonl
```

The workflow keeps the latest 7 backups per WebDAV directory and cleans both `.jsonl` and legacy `.json` files. If the secret is missing, invalid, or a target fails, the workflow logs a warning and continues.

### Multi-target Render deploy hooks

The workflow uses one optional JSON secret for all Render deploy hooks:

```text
CLIPROXY_RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOKS
```

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "cpa-main",
    "hook_url": "https://api.render.com/deploy/srv-xxx?key=xxx"
  }
]
```

`url` is also accepted as an alias for `hook_url`. If the secret is missing, invalid, or a target fails, the workflow logs a warning and continues.

### Telegram notification secrets

- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

## Local validation

Validate the embedded usage package against an upstream checkout:

```bash
cp -R /path/to/CLIProxyAPI /tmp/cliproxy-check
rm -rf /tmp/cliproxy-check/internal/embeddedusage
cp -R cliproxyapi-pro-core/embeddedusage /tmp/cliproxy-check/internal/embeddedusage
cp cliproxyapi-pro-core/patches/account_inspection_scheduler.go /tmp/account_inspection_scheduler.go
SRC_ROOT=/tmp/cliproxy-check python3 cliproxyapi-pro-core/patches/apply_upstream_patches.py
go -C /tmp/cliproxy-check mod tidy
go -C /tmp/cliproxy-check test ./internal/embeddedusage/...
```

Validate entrypoint syntax:

```bash
sh -n cliproxyapi-pro-core/entrypoint.sh
```
